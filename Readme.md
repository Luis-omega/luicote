# LuiCoTe (Luis code templates)
Mi personal collection of templates and little scripts to trigger them

Right now is Haskell specific.


## Build instructions

The project depends on jinja2 in python, you need to execute it in a 
environment with it.

The project expects to be located under folder "$HOME/projects"

## Usage

Ensure you are in a environment with jinja2 available, then 
ensure you allowed the script "luicote" to execute.

Then you can do:

luicote project_name


And you will get a new Haskell project under "$HOME/project/project_name"
